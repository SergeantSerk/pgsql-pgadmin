# pgsql-pgadmin
Scripts to start from zero for deploying PostgreSQL and pgAdmin on minikube.

**Note: please vet these scripts and configs to fit them for your own use as security was not always in mind when making these.**

## Usage
1. Run `pre-docker.sh` if and only if you don't have Docker installed
2. Run `post-docker.sh`.
3. Run `port-forward.sh` to be able to access pgAdmin.
